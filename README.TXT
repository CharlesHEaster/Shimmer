    perform to protect the hive using a 2D hex grid.

Final notes:
I have achieved what I set out to do.  I'm still not happy with the Hex.decernHex() method, I am sure there is a better way to do it.
I am also sure that I could better orginize some functions and variables into more appropriate classes.
In the future I may revisit this project and try to integrate real time GUI sliders for most of the variables.
If you have any advise or critiques, please pass them on.
